# QuizApp

QuizApp is a Java Swing quiz application where users enter a name, answer multiple-choice questions, and receive instant feedback after each question. At the end of a session, the final score is shown and the user’s highscore is stored so it can be viewed later.

The app includes a main menu and separate screens for playing the quiz and viewing highscores.
